#at -4F, which might be a little to a lot less than below depending on how many kWh the
#range corresponds to (temperature adjusted or not?? - since this is reported by the car, it is likely temperature adjusted)

#T.S. reports 10 miles of range loss while parked for 2 hours, unplugged, at 28F (Tesla Y),
#at .28 kwh/mile, this is 1.4kWh/hr!  This is far above the range of any linear fit tried.
